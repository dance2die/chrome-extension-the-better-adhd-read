# Privacy Policy for Better ADHD Read

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-26

Thank you for choosing to use **Better ADHD Read** ("the Extension"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the information we collect and how we use it.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.** 

The Extension operates entirely offline and locally within your browser. All text processing and highlighting features are executed on your device using built-in browser capabilities (such as `Intl.Segmenter`). No text or reading habits are sent to any external servers.

## 2. Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- **`storage`**: Used exclusively to persist your locally selected highlight color, theme mode, and highlight opacity preferences across sessions. This data never leaves your device.
- **`activeTab`**: Required to read the text of the webpage you are currently viewing and apply highlight formatting when you click.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Analytics

The Extension does not use any third-party tracking, analytics, or monetization services.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and include the changes alongside extension updates.
